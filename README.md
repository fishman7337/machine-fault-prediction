# Machine Fault Prediction

A predictive maintenance project that uses real-world sensor data to detect machine faults. Implements a **Voting Classifier** ensemble to enhance predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability for industrial applications.

---

## Overview
This project develops a classification model for predicting whether a machine is operating normally or is likely to experience a fault. Leveraging real-world sensor data, the system is designed for high reliability in industrial environments.
